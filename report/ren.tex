\section{The quant workflow}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Universe selection.} We define some universe of stocks that have some self similary. Also we should eliminate all stocks prohibited or illegal to trade.

\item \textbf{Single $\alpha$ factor model}. Define and evaluate individual epressions which rank the cross section of equities. 

\item \textbf{Alpha combination	}. Combine many single alpha factor into a signal $\alpha$ factor.  The combined alpha factor will have better prediction power than the best single alpha factor. This is because of the noise from the alpha factors cancel each other out.

\item \textbf{Risk model} Define and calculate a set of risk factors you want to use to constrain you portfolio.

\item \textbf{portofolio construction} Implement a process which takes yourfinal combined alpha and your risk model and produces a target portfolio that minimises risk under your model.

\item \textbf{Eecution Implement} a trading process to transition the current portfolio to the target portfolio.
